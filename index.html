                            Welcome to my page! My name’s Dorrian. I’m 24 years old and based in Sacramento, CA. Hailing from Columbus, OH, I relocated to California in 2017 to take an Americorps job as a student mentor in an elementary school. By the time I completed my year-long term-of-service, however, Sacramento had become my new home. I had quickly formed many deep friendships, plugged into the vibrant local music and art scene, and fell in love with the weather in the region. So I decided to stay, and the rest is history!                            <br> <br>
                            As a student in UC Davis’ Full Stack Flex coding bootcamp, I am currently amassing a range of web development skills including browser based technologies (such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, and responsive design—to name a few), API interaction, server side development, deployment, and quality assurance. New to computer science, my background lies in education & childcare. In my free time, I love to cook, explore the beauty of my Northern Californian surroundings, and play music with my friends. I’m passionate about economic justice and human dignity, and my ideal job would be with a company or organization that advances those values.                        </p>
